spring boot security login application

Spring Boot application automatically requires the Basic Authentication for all HTTP Endpoints. The Endpoint “/” and “/home” does not require any authentication.

## Spring security Overview

Spring security is the highly customizable authentication and access-control framework. This is the security module for securing spring applications. But, this can also be used for non-spring based application with few extra configurations to enable the security features. Spring Security is a framework that focuses on providing both authentication and authorization to Java applications.
  
  ### “Authentication” is the process of establishing a principal is who they claim to be (a “principal” generally means a user, device or some other system which can perform an action in your application).
  
  ### “Authorization” refers to the process of deciding whether a principal is allowed to perform an action within your application. To arrive at the point where an authorization decision is needed, the identity of the principal has already been established by the authentication process. These concepts are common, and not at all specific to Spring Security.
